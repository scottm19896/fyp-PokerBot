Meeting Minutes:

Date: 8/10/18
Today we discussed the strategies for the poker bots going forward.
Both myself and another student will work on the full variation of Limit Hold’em with the option of cutting out calculations as I progress.
Initially starting on the flop and alternating rounds.
Main Points for next meeting:
•	Tutorials and further knowledge about Neural Nets
•	Research Limit Hold’em
•	Start Development and setting out a plan.

Date: 22/10/18
We discussed the progress up to this point. I talked about the path I wish to take going forward.
Main Points for next meeting:
•	Setting up bot shells for comparing neural nets.
•	CFR- Reading and practice
•	Lay out my bot strategies, what I wish to achieve.

Date: 05/11/18
Explained some of the research I am doing. Finished my bot shell with space for neural networks
Explained the comparison approach I hope to take with honest/dishonest bot.

Main Points for next meeting:
•	Finish implementing honest dishonest bots.
•	Research CFR by alberta and Libratus to understand Limitations
•	Research other algorithms that might prove succesful

Date: 19/11/18
Oulined some of the points I found about CFR
Main Points for next meeting:
•	Decide approach to take i.e keep Researching PokerCNN, and Case-Based Reasoning
•	Decide what to accomplish from the project.(My comparison idea for future final year projects)

Date: 03/12/18
Continued to discuss project.Outlined my progress and explained why I have chosen PokerCNN over CFR.
Main Points for next meeting:
•	Finish Interim Report for feedback.Outline is on moodle.
•	Continue to work on PokerCNN-Working with convolutional neural network
•	Start work on pure CFR algorithm-Using One layer of abstraction
